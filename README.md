# Overview

My name is Homero Kemmerich, I'm very into robotics and programming and I am majoring Computer Engineering at Universidade de Passo Fundo, Brazil.

I have experience in mobile development with Xamarin Forms and I am currently working on a project involving image processing.

A mobile development fan and Linux enthusiast.

I'm also an enthusiast of Agile Development, mostly Scrum and Kanban.

If I had to pick a project to work on right now, I would probably pick modding for a game or developing one from scratch. I've always been interested in game design, and I am a very creative person.
